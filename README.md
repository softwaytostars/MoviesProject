There is a chance that some director(s) and some(actors) applied for another movie at year +-1 and for the same genre.
It will be considered as false positive and diminish the K/N factor.
We could diminish the ratio of false positive by requiring an exact match between genre, director and actors but that would 
diminish more the K/M factor this time.
More chance to miss some duplicates since we consider as duplicate any movie that has common genre, actors and directors.
